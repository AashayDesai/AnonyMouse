Anonymous venting about your sexuality to people who care.

The AnonyMouse vision is to connect closeted LGBT individuals, through an anonymous question and answer format, with mentors who have similar experiences in order to foster a relationship between the two.

This idea was based on my personal experiences of being a closeted gay Division 1 level collegiate athlete. I yearned for a resource that would allow me to anonymously confide in someone I trusted and someone I could look up to. Someone that had gone through a similar process and someone who I could sustain a relationship with rather than simply get a quick answer to a question.
